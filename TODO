- Possible bug in original FreeEMS implementation and our (simplifying)
  adjustments lead to unrealistic behaviour:

  The cycle for one channel consists of PrimaryRPMISR, InjectionISR opening
  and closing the valve, IgnitionDwellISR and IgnitionFireISR.
  When executing EMSBench, the times for most these ISRs are constant
  (relative to the PrimaryRPMISR), and only the time of closing the injection
  valve varies. This means, that the amount of fuel injected into the engine
  varies. Assuming the adjustments we made to the code, we would rather expect
  that the injection time is constant, but the IgnitionFire should vary
  as it clearly must depend on the engine's current speed.
  Concerning the injection, there seems to be a bug in the original
  implementation, which we expect to be fixed in newer versions. The
  constant offset for IgnitionFire is related to our adjustments, where
  where we set a constant number (fuelAndIgnitionCalcs.c:198, see comment
  there).

  Possible solutions:
  1) Use current version of FreeEMS for EMSBench, or
  2) Backport corrections from current version
  Both solutions are expected to require a large effort!

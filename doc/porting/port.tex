To port EMSbench to a new platform \verb+$NPF+, take the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create copy of the \verb+embedded/arch/default/+ directory, or
  create the \verb+embedded/arch/$NPF+ structure from scratch.
\item Copy the include files from the \verb+default+ directory. Adjust
  appropriately, if you want to use macros instead of function calls
  in places.
\item Implement the remaining functions in the appropriate \verb+hal*/+
  directories.
  Make sure to follow the callback functions in your interrupt
  handlers.
\item If your platform needs a \ac{bsp}, place it inside the
  \verb+bsp+ directory.
  Also, make an approriate \verb+Makefile+ available.
\item Write the configuration files for \verb+make+ according to
  sect.~\ref{ss:benv:pspec}.
\item If necessary, add further compilation parameters to the relevant
  \verb+make+ flags (e.g. \verb$CFLAGS += ...$).
\item Add your platform to the \code{PLATFORMS} array in
  \verb+/builder/data.py+.
  If your platform requires building of an additional \ac{bsp}, set
  the second parameter to \verb+True+.
  The build process will use the \verb+Makefile+ in the platform's
  \verb+bsp/+ subdirectory.
\end{enumerate}

Trace Generator:
================
- ON times of primary/secondary signal (OFF times are omitted for
performance)
- Information about renormalisation after each full crank shaft
revolution
- Information about phase changes


EMS:
====

PrimaryRPMISR:
--------------
p[num]: when the signal was detected

EP s1: missing sync

EP s2: lost sync

P2: this is a "second pulse" where injection/ignition must be set for
one channel

PP: really set injection/ignition

E: invalid channels [num] [num]: error in calculation

P@[A]: Na[B]@[C]: schedule injection for channel [B] for time [C], ISR
was triggered by signal at time [A] (should be the same as in p[num]),
*a*ctivate ECT channel

P@[A]: Nq[B]@[C]: same as above, but channel was already active

P@[A]: IDa[B]@[C]: schedule ignitionDwell for channel [B] with offset
[C] from now ([A]), ISR was triggered by signal at time [A] (should be
the same as in p[num]), *a*ctivate PIT channel

P@[A]: IDd[B]@[C]: same as above, but channel was already active

P@[A]: IDq[B]@[C]: same as above, but queue event as another must be
performed before

P@[A]: IFa[B]@[C]: schedule ignitionFire for channel [B] with offset
[C] from now ([A]), ISR was triggered by signal at time [A] (should be
the same as in p[num]), *a*ctivate PIT channel

P@[A]: IFd[B]@[C]: same as above, but channel was already active

P@[A]: IFq[B]@[C]: same as above, but queue event as another must be
performed before

P1: this was the first pulse, doe nothing

P@->0: this was the LOW edge of signal, do nothing

*p[X][T]: [T] is the runtime of PrimaryPRMISR measured in processor cycles.
		  [X] identifyes the codepath that was executed. Possible values are
		  	 a: missing sync (see also "EP s1" above)
		  	 b: lost sync (see also "EP s2" above) 
		  	 e: an even number of primary signals are counted and calculations
		  	    have to be performed (see also "P2" above)
		  	 u: an uneven number of primary pulses have been counted so nothing is done.

SecondaryRPMISR:
--------------
*s[T]: [T] is the runtime of SecondaryPRMISR measured in processor cycles.

InjectorXISR:
-------------

Nh[A]@[B]: Nl@[C]: injector channel [A] to HIGH at time [B], set IRQ
for time [C] to pull to LOW

Nl[A]@[B]: injector channel [A] pulled to LOW at time [B]

Nlur@[A]: set HIGH time for another injection at time [A]

*i[X][A]-[T]: [T] is the runtime of Injector[A]ISR measured in processor cycles.
			  [X] identifyes the codepath that was executed. Possilbe values are
			  	  h: injection was started by pulling the output pin to high
			  	  l: injection was ended by pulling the output pin to low. 

IgnitionDwellISR:
-----------------
ID[A]@[B] [C]: dwelling of ignition coil for channel [A] after counter
[B] elapsed, ISR started at time [C]

IDr[A]@[B]: set a queued dwell event for channel [A] with time offset
[B]

*d[A]-[T]: [T] is the runtime of IgnitionDwellISR for channel [A] measured in processor cycles.

IgnitionFireISR:
----------------
IF[A]@[B] [C]: ignition fired for channel [A] after counter [B]
elapsed, ISR started at time [C]

IFr[A]@[B]: set a queued dwell event for channel [A] with time offset
[B]

*f[A]-[T]: [T] is the runtime of IgnitionFireISR for channel [A] measured in processor cycles.

RTIISR:
-------
*rtX[T]: [T] is the runtime of the RTIISR() function that gets called every 125us.
         X can be one of the following path identifiers
          x : nothing had to be done.
          a : only the ms (mili second) counter was counted up.
          b : ms counter was counted up and the 'force ADC reading'
              flag was set.
          c : the ms and 1/10-th counter was counted up. Maybe the 'force ADC 
              reading' flag was set. 
          d : the ms and 1/10-th counter was counted up and evrythich that has to
              be done every 0.1s was executed. For now only portHDebounce is 
              decremented by one. Maybe the 'force ADC reading' flag was set. 
          e : the ms 1/10th and second counter were counted up. Maybe the
              'force ADC reading' flag was set and or portHDebounce was decreased
              by one.  
          f : the ms 1/10th, second and minute counter were counted up. Maybe the
              'force ADC reading' flag was set and or portHDebounce was decreased
              by one.

freeems_main:
-------------
*r[T]: [T] ist the runtime oft the atomic code block in main_freeems where the current sensor data is being read.

*sr[T]: [T] is the runtime of the atomic code block in main_freeems where the sensor data sets are swapped before 
performing ignition and injection calculations.

*sii[T]: [T] is the runtime of the atomic code block in main_freeems where the datasets containing the calculated 
injection and ignition values are swapped.

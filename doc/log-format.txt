Trace Generator:
================
- ON times of primary/secondary signal (OFF times are omitted for
performance)
- Information about renormalisation after each full crank shaft
revolution
- Information about phase changes


EMS:
====

PrimaryRPMISR:
--------------
p[num]: when the signal was detected

EP s1: missing sync

EP s2: lost sync

P2: this is a "second pulse" where injection/ignition must be set for
one channel

PP: really set injection/ignition

E: invalid channels [num] [num]: error in calculation

P@[A]: Na[B]@[C]: schedule injection for channel [B] for time [C], ISR
was triggered by signal at time [A] (should be the same as in p[num]),
*a*ctivate ECT channel

P@[A]: Nq[B]@[C]: same as above, but channel was already active

P@[A]: IDa[B]@[C]: schedule ignitionDwell for channel [B] with offset
[C] from now ([A]), ISR was triggered by signal at time [A] (should be
the same as in p[num]), *a*ctivate PIT channel

P@[A]: IDd[B]@[C]: same as above, but channel was already active

P@[A]: IDq[B]@[C]: same as above, but queue event as another must be
performed before

P@[A]: IFa[B]@[C]: schedule ignitionFire for channel [B] with offset
[C] from now ([A]), ISR was triggered by signal at time [A] (should be
the same as in p[num]), *a*ctivate PIT channel

P@[A]: IFd[B]@[C]: same as above, but channel was already active

P@[A]: IFq[B]@[C]: same as above, but queue event as another must be
performed before

P1: this was the first pulse, doe nothing

P@->0: this was the LOW edge of signal, do nothing

SecondaryRPMISR:
--------------


InjectorXISR:
-------------

Nh[A]@[B]: Nl@[C]: injector channel [A] to HIGH at time [B], set IRQ
for time [C] to pull to LOW

Nl[A]@[B]: injector channel [A] pulled to LOW at time [B]

Nlur@[A]: set HIGH time for another injection at time [A]


IgnitionDwellISR:
-----------------
ID[A]@[B] [C]: dwelling of ignition coil for channel [A] after counter
[B] elapsed, ISR started at time [C]

IDr[A]@[B]: set a queued dwell event for channel [A] with time offset
[B]



IgnitionFireISR:
----------------
IF[A]@[B] [C]: ignition fired for channel [A] after counter [B]
elapsed, ISR started at time [C]

IFr[A]@[B]: set a queued dwell event for channel [A] with time offset
[B]

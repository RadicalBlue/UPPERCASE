\section{Parameters}
\label{s:parameters}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

All parameters and associated units are depicted in
table~\ref{t:parameters}.
Please note that we use rounds (revolution of the crank shaft) as unit
for angular parameters to simplifie calculations.

  \label{t:tyre}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{c@{/}ccccc}
    195 & 70 & R & 14 & 86 & H\\\hline
    $w$ & $r_t$ & - & $d_r$ & - & -
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tyres with (see also tab.~\ref{t:tyre}):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Width $w$ [mm]
  \item Aspect ratio $r_t$ [\%]
  \item Rim diameter $d_r$ ["]
  \end{itemize}
\item Transmission ratio of cardan shaft and/or axle $r_a$
\item Transmission ratios of gears $\{G_1\ldots G_5\}$
\item idle speed of engine $U_I [\mbox{min}^{-1}]$
\item derived idle speed of engine:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:omega:idle}
    \omega_I=\frac{U_I}{60}\frac{\mbox{min}}{\mbox{s}}
  \end{equation}

\end{itemize}

Calculation of tyre circumference:
\begin{itemize}
\item Flank height $h_f [\mbox{mm}]$ of tyre:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:flank}
    h_f = w\frac{r}{100}
  \end{equation}
\item Wheel diameter $d_w [\mbox{mm}]$:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:wdiam}
    d_w = 2.54\frac{\mbox{mm}}{\mbox{in}}d_r + 2h_f
  \end{equation}
\item Tyre circumference $C$:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:tcirc}
    c_w = \pi d_w
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Driving Cycle}
\label{ss:parameters:cycle}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

phase:
\begin{itemize}
\item acceleration $a [\frac{m}{s^2}]$
\item speed $v_s, v_e [\frac{km}{h}]$
\item duration $d [s]$
\item gear $g [0\ldots 5]$; gear $0$ stands for any time the engine is
  idle, i.e. when the clutch is pressed and thus disconnects the wheels from the engine.
\end{itemize}

Basic calculations:
\begin{itemize}
\item acceleration $\dot{\omega}_w$ of wheel (if $a\not=0$):
  \begin{equation}
    \dot{\omega}_w =
    \frac{a}{\frac{d_w}{1000}\frac{\mbox{m}}{\mbox{mm}}}
  \end{equation}
\item acceleration $\dot{\omega}_c$ of crank shaft (if $a\not=0$):
  \begin{equation}
    \dot{\omega}_c = \dot{\omega}_w G_g r_a
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

A simple example for a driving cycle is shown in table~\ref{t:cycle:example}.
Further examples can be found in appendix~\ref{s:dc}.

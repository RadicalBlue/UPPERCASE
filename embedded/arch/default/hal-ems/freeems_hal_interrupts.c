 * The hal has to generate the following interrupt calls to the FreeEMS code.
 *
 * 1. Every 125us call RTIISR() to update the internal clock
 * 2. Whenever the real time clock counter reaches a multiple of 2ยนโถ = 65536
 *    call TimerOverflow()
 * 3. When the pin state of the RPM meter changes call PrimaryRPMISR()
 *    or SecondaryRPMISR()
 * 4. When the ignition dwell timer elapses call IgnitionDwellISR()
 * 5. When the ignition fire timer elapses call IgnitionFireISR()
 * 6. When one of the injection timers elapses call the respective
 *    Injector1ISR(), Injector2ISR(), Injector3ISR(), ...

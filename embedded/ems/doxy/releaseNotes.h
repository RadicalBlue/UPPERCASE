/** @page releaseNotes Release Notes
 *
 * This page contains a list of all notable properties of this release. To see
 * the release notes from older releases see the @subpage oldReleaseNotes page.
 *
 * @b General @b Notes
 *
 * This release comes to you mostly courtesy of Sean Keys who has done an outstanding job producing an
 * XGATE assembler and linker for us to use! Sean's work can not be valued enough, it will be absolutely
 * essential for future versions to perform to the high standards that we try to adhere to. One nice side
 * effect of the tools being new, is that they now work exactly the same way on all platforms. This now
 * includes Windows Vista upon which the previous tools would not even run due to a small bug in the GCC
 * used to build them.
 *
 * I would like to thank quite a few people for their involvment in this release:
 *
 * - Sean Keys - Wrote XGATE assembler and other binutils, hacked XGATE into FreeEMS, created debian repo
 * - David Andruczyk - Built windows installer and created scripts to make this repeatable
 * - Steve Ball - Mac OS X fink tools packaging
 * - Dave Cramer - Support verifying the Mac tools
 * - Charles Wilson - Mac OS X testing
 * - Tim Sutherland - Windows testing
 * - Tim Zimmerman - Windows testing
 * - Adrian Dickson - Windows testing
 * - Me - Makefile changes, integrating Sean's hacking, Linux testing
 *
 * Finally, this release would not be possible if not for the kindness of numerous people that have donated
 * money and food to the cause. During the development of 0.1.1 I have been homeless, living in my car, with
 * no income and very little money. Just yesterday the last of the money ran out, and I am now living only
 * on FreeEMS donations from car enthusiasts around the world. My most sincere and heart-felt thanks to each
 * and every one of you! Most appreciated!
 *
 * If anyone else wants to contribute, contact me through any medium for the details.
 *
 * The new XGATE tools and information on them are available from here:
 *
 * - <a href="http://tools.diyefi.org"><b>FreeEMS Tools</b></a>
 *
 * @b New @b Features:
 * - XGATE core is functional, simple proof code in place
 * - Decoder interface skeleton in place
 * - Build is completely cross platform Linux/MacOSX/Windows
 *
 * @b Differences:
 * - ADC sampling more accurate
 * - freeemsLoader.bash script checks for dat file
 * - Linker script fix for F8 page
 * - PDF documentation only generated for releases
 *
 * @b Known @b Issues:
 * - Same as last release, only.

/** @page releaseNotes_0_1_0 FreeEMS 0.1.0 UltraJizz
 *
 * A version of the code very similar to 0.1.0 was the first version of FreeEMS to run an engine! That
 * is the reason for moving the versioning from the 0.0.X series to the 0.1.X series. After a few minor
 * false starts, FreeEMS first ran in Baltimore on Friday October 23rd, 2009 at around 2:15am GMT. The
 * first drive was in Pompano Beach on Sunday November 1st, 2009 at around 8:45pm GMT. The first tuning
 * occurred in Naples, Florida at around 1:00am local time on Thursday November 5th, 2009 using freshly
 * written code git pulled from Aaron Barnes in Wellingon NZ in real time. The first significant drive
 * was from there up to Tampa covering ~150 miles and arriving at ~3am. Seat of pants wideband-free
 * tuning continued in Tampa over the next few days after which time the car ran exclusively (and most
 * excellently) on FreeEMS. I drove it from Tampa to Daytona Beach and then up to Atlanta Georgia with
 * Rob Ebersol fine tuning as we went. The first FreeEMS was finally uninstalled on the afternoon of
 * Monday November 9th, 2009 in Atlana after covering around 900 miles or 1500 km. During that time eight
 * people, including myself, rode in and winessed the first FreeEMS powered vehicle.
 *
 * The version that I used on my B230F powered Volvo 740GL wagon was a little less functional and more
 * hacked together. What you see here represents the same code tidied up and with some minor bug fixes
 * and documentation changes. Also note that the car used fuel-only control, not full control. When an
 * engine is run with fuel and ignition control, I will release 0.2.0 to mark the occasion.
 *
 * The version of the tuner used to talk to and tune the very first FreeEMS prototype can be found with
 * the following git commit hash 5188317b6e7418238686602d3b787250398f1ad4 or more conveniently at the
 * following link http://github.com/fredcooke/freeems-tuner/commit/5188317b6e7418238686602d3b787250398f1ad4
 *
 * To get the exact code used on the volvo, take any hash between 97f5ad1f0e6b2ef30bd987c3becc764a5d658bf5
 * and 0cc18370652f096cbcca2226e779a0370a77b113, go to line 110 or 111 of src/coreVarsGenerator.c, change
 * TRUE to FALSE and build. What you have if you do the above is exactly what I used on my Volvo sans the
 * tune itself. If you want the tune too, the S19 is included in the firmware directory. Here is a link to
 * the code : http://github.com/fredcooke/freeems-vanilla/commit/0cc18370652f096cbcca2226e779a0370a77b113
 *
